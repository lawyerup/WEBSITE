      "Within just a week of being a LawyerUp intern, I've already been exposed to areas of law that I had never even considered before like cybersecurity law. I also had my resume and LinkedIn optimized for recruiters and expanded my network exponentially as an Intern. It's provided me with so much insight into how the legal field works, especially as a United Kingdom student looking to qualify in the United States",

      "LawyerUp offers an 'inner internship' called ScholarUp which I am so thankful for as it has greatly enhanced my thinking, research and writing in the law, and has helped me think more creatively when it comes to law! It has really tested my values and morals, and has required me to deeply reflect on the weekly topics given such as pillars of punishment, and mental health and law. ScholarUp is a challenge and I am up for it!",

Furthermore, the fact that it is a virtual internship made it accessible for anyone around the globe, including myself in the UK. LawyerUp gave me the opportunity to learn about several different areas of law - both broad and niche areas.",
