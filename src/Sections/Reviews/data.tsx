      "Within just a week of being a LawyerUp intern, I've already been exposed to areas of law that I had never even considered before like cybersecurity law. I also had my resume and LinkedIn optimized for recruiters and expanded my network exponentially as an Intern. It's provided me with so much insight into how the legal field works, especially as a United Kingdom student looking to qualify in the United States",

Not only has it encouraged me to explore more into questions of law that I hadn't encountered before, but it has also given me the opportunity to share my thoughts with students from different countries and cultures which is not something I've gotten the chance to do before. I want to sincerely thank the extremely dedicated group of students that make ScholarUp possible for helping me broaden my perspective.",

      "LawyerUp offers an 'inner internship' called ScholarUp which I am so thankful for as it has greatly enhanced my thinking, research and writing in the law, and has helped me think more creatively when it comes to law! It has really tested my values and morals, and has required me to deeply reflect on the weekly topics given such as pillars of punishment, and mental health and law. ScholarUp is a challenge and I am up for it!",
